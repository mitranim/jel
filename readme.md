## Changelog

### 0.2.0

Update to match the recent breaking changes in the `sqlb` package.

### 0.1.3

Breaking: removed `Ord` after moving it to `sqlb`, which is a dependency of this package.

### 0.1.2

Minor breaking change: `Ord` now uses the `nulls last` qualifier. We might want to make this configurable in the future.

### 0.1.1

Added `Ords` for SQL `order by`.

The new type `Ords` represents an SQL `order by` clause in a structured fashion, and allows to safely decode it from client input. Just like `Expr`, decoding `Ords` is performed by consulting a user-specified struct type. JSON field names are converted to DB column names, unknown fields cause a parse error. When encoding for SQL, identifiers are quoted for safety.

Minor breaking change: renamed `ExprFrom` â†’ `ExprFor`.

### 0.1.0

First tagged release.
